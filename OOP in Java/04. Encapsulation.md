# Packages
- the ones that store different classes and can be accessed when needed
- one class from a package can be accessed in another package in another class using the 'import' keyword
- constructor for the same can be created as :
  ```java
  package_name.class_name object_name = new package_name.class_name();

# Access modifiers
- not all data is to be given access to so access modifiers allow to limit access to some content
- 4 types :
  - public - can be accessed in other classes and packages
  - private - can bw accessed only in that class and to make it accessable elsewhere getters & setters are used
  - protected - can be accessed by all classes in the current package and subclasses in other package
  - default - when no access modifier is specified it becomes default and can be accessed throughout the package

  Example :
  ```java
  package bank;

  class Account {

      public String name;
      protected String email;
      private String password;

      public String getPassword() {

          return this.password;
      }

      public void setPassword(String password) {

          this.password = password;
      }
  }

  public class Bank() {

      public static void main(String[] args) {

          Account account1 = new Account();
          account1.name = "Krishna";
          account1.email = "krishna5000@gmail.com";
          account1.setPassword = "Radha";
          System.out.println(account1.getPassword);
      }
  }

# What is OOP?
- Object Oriented Programming
- helps tackle real world problems
- includes classes and objects

# What are classes?
- are like a blueprint for the whole code
- are accessed using objects

# What are objects?
- used to access the classes
- have different properties - variables accessed through object are called data while methods are called members


Example : 
```java
public class Pen {

  String color;
  String type;

  public void write() {

    System.out.println("writing something");
  }

  public void printColor() {
    System.out.println(this.color); // this keyword accesses the object that is being called and the value gets assigned accordingly
  }
}

public class OOPS {

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Pen pen1 = new Pen();
    pen1.color = "blue";
    pen1.type = "gel";

    Pen pen2 = new Pen();
    pen2.color = "black";
    pen2.type = "ballpoint";

    pen1.write();
    pen1.printColor();
    pen2.printColor();
  }
}

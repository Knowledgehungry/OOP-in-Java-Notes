# What is OOP?
- Object Oriented Programming
- helps tackle real world problems
- includes classes and objects

# What are classes?
- are like a blueprint for the whole code
- are accessed using objects
- every class has a constructor that used to call the object

# What are objects?
- used to access the classes
- have different properties - variables accessed through object are called data while methods are called members


  Example : 
  ```java
  public class Pen {
  
    String color;
    String type;
  
    public void write() {
  
      System.out.println("writing something");
    }
  
    public void printColor() {
      System.out.println(this.color); // this keyword accesses the object that is being called and the value gets assigned accordingly
    }
  }
  
  public class OOPS {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
  
      Pen pen1 = new Pen(); // the new keyword allocates memory in the memory heap using the object
      pen1.color = "blue";
      pen1.type = "gel";
  
      Pen pen2 = new Pen(); // here Pen() is a constructor that initialized the object 
      pen2.color = "black";
      pen2.type = "ballpoint";
  
      pen1.write();
      pen1.printColor();
      pen2.printColor();
    }
  }
  
  
  OUTPUT :
  writing something
  blue
  black


# Constructors
- Constructors have the same name as the class and do not have a return type 
- Constructors are called only once
- three types of constuctors :
  - non-parameterised constructor
    Example :
    ```java
    class Student {

        String name;
        int age;

        public void printInfo() {

            System.out.println(this.name);
            System.out.println(this.age);
        }

        Student() {

            System.out.println("constructor called"); // this gets called everytime the constructor is formed
        }
    }

    public class OOP {

        Student s1 = new Student();
        s1.name = "Krishna";
        s1.age = 5000;

        s1.printInfo();
    }


    OUTPUT :
    constructor called
    Krishna
    5000

  - parameterised constructor
    Example :
    ```java
    class Student {

        String name;
        int age;

        public void printInfo() {

            System.out.println(this.name);
            System.out.println(this.age);
        }

        Student(String name, int age) {

            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }

    public class OOP {

        Student s1 = new Student("Krishna", 5000); // this assigns the value to name and age

        s1.printInfo();
    }


    OUTPUT :
    Krishna
    5000

  - copy constructor
    Example :
    ```java
    class Student {

        String name;
        int age;

        public void printInfo() {

            System.out.println(this.name);
            System.out.println(this.age);
        }

        Student(Student s2) {

            this.name = s2.name;
            this.age = s2.age;
        }

        Student() {
            // constructor is for s1 since we did not make a constructor for it
        }
    }

    public class OOP {

        Student s1 = new Student();
        s1.name = "Krishna";
        s1.age = 5000;

        Student s2 = new Student(s1); // properties of s1 are being given to s2
        s2.printInfo();
    }


    OUTPUT :
    Krishna
    5000


NOTE : In Java, destructors are not there because Java has garbage collector that automatically destroys the objects that have been created

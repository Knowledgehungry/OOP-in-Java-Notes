# Inheritance
- the process of passing down of properties from one class to another
- increases reusability i.e the same code can be used in subclasses using inheritance
- the class that gives it properties is the base class/ parent class and the class that takes the properties is the subclass/
  child class

  Example :
  ```java
  class Shape {

      String color;
  }

  class Triangle extends Shape {

      System.out.println("The triangle is " + color + " color");
  }

  public class OOP {

      public static void main(String[] args) {

          Triangle t1 = new Triangle();
          t1.color = "red";
      }
  }
  
- 4 types :
  - single level inheritance

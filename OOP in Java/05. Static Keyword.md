# Static
- the properties that are gonna be the same throughout the class are defined as static
- can be directly accessed using the class name instead of creating an object
- memeory gets allocated only once 

  Example :
  ```java
  class Student {

      String name;
      static String school;

      public static void changeSchool() {

          school = "CMS";
      }
  }

  public class OOP {

      public static void main(String[] args) {

          Student.school = "VNEMS";
          Student student1 = new Student();
          student1.name = "Krishna";
          System.out.println(student1.school);
      }
  }
